Descriptions:

This repository implements a 3D facial recognition system utilizing HK segmentation to extract key facial regions and a combination of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction and Support Vector Machines (SVM) for classification.
This project explores the robustness of 3D facial recognition under controlled and uncontrolled environments. It leverages PCA to reduce data complexity and SVM for efficient pattern matching, achieving promising results on the GAVAB database.
This code demonstrates a 3D facial recognition approach using HK segmentation for feature extraction, PCA to handle high-dimensional data, and SVM for robust classification. It aims for accurate recognition in both controlled and uncontrolled settings.



Features:

Implements HK segmentation for automatic facial region extraction in 3D meshes.
Utilizes PCA to reduce data dimensionality for efficient processing.
Leverages SVM for robust facial recognition under varying conditions.
Achieves high recognition rates on the GAVAB 3D facial database.
